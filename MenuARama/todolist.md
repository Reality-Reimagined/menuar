okay maybe i wasnt too clear. the Pizza Paradise 
menu should stay on the dashboard if you are not 
logged in. when you click the demo in the footer 
its should take you there, if not logged in. 
but when you are logged in your resturant menus
should be created there an save in your dashboard,
not just creating a toast notification but actually
creating a menu like we have when we originally 
started with this app, and it should have persistence
like we used to have. lets also improve the create new
menu and when all the menus are done they should look
similar to the pizza paradise menu just with custom
logos and more menu items. lets improve on this.
